# Parcel starter template with sass
#### sass(^1.32.8) 

- `npm run dev` - starts a dev server watches for file changes.
-  `npm run build` - build and minifies files into the dist folder.
 
----------

- Delete the dist and tmp folder before running build, as when running build again it contains the old css and js files.

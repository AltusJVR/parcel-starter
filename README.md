##`npm i parcel-sass-starter`
### Parcel starter template with sass


- `npm run dev` - starts a dev server on http://localhost:8080/ and watches for file changes.
-  `npm run build` - build and minifies files into the dist folder.
 

 #### This npm mudule uses the parcel and Dart-sass (^1.32.8). 

----------

This package was created as a personal starter to practice Sass and setting up a task runner. I settled on Parcel as it was easy to set up and made sense for my workflow.
